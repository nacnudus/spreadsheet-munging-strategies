#  Other gotchas

This part is a collection of gotchas that don't fit anywhere else.

## Non-text headers e.g. dates

![](images/non-text-headers.png)

At the time of writing, readxl doesn't convert Excel dates to R dates when they
are in the header row.

Using tidyxl and unpivotr, you can choose to make a cell of any data type into a
tidy 'header', and you can reformat it as text before `spatter()` turns it into
the header of a data frame.  Another way to format headers as part of the
`behead()` will be shown later.

```{r}
path <- system.file("extdata", "worked-examples.xlsx", package = "unpivotr")
xlsx_cells(path, sheet = "non-text headers") %>%
  behead("left", name) %>%
  behead("up", `academic-year`) %>%
  mutate(`academic-year` = strftime(`academic-year`, "%Y")) %>%
  select(row, data_type, `academic-year`, name, numeric) %>%
  spatter(`academic-year`) %>%
  select(-row)
```

When a single set of headers is of mixed data types, e.g. some character and
some date, `behead()` chooses the correct ones using the `data_type` column,
before converting them all to text via `format()`.

```{r}
xlsx_cells(path, sheet = "non-text headers") %>%
  select(row, col, data_type, character, numeric, date) %>%
  behead("up", header)
```

To format a header when a single set of headers are of mixed data types, you
can specify a function for each data type in the call to `behead()`.

```{r}
xlsx_cells(path, sheet = "non-text headers") %>%
  select(row, col, data_type, character, numeric, date) %>%
  behead("up", header, formatters = list(date = ~ strftime(.x, "%Y"),
                                        character = toupper))
```

## Data embedded in comments

![](images/comments.png)

Comment strings are availabe in the `comment` column, just like `character`.
Comments can have formatting, but tidyxl doesn't yet import the formatting.  If
you need this, please open an
[issue](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl/issues).  It would probably be
imported into a `comment_formatted` column, similarly to `character_formatted`.

```{r}
path <- system.file("extdata", "worked-examples.xlsx", package = "unpivotr")
xlsx_cells(path, sheet = "comments") %>%
  select(row, col, data_type, character, numeric, comment) %>%
  behead("up", "header")
```

Comments apply to single cells, so follow the same procedure as "Already a tidy
table but with meaningful formatting of single cells".

```{r}
cells <-
  xlsx_cells(path, sheet = "comments") %>%
  select(row, col, data_type, character, numeric, comment)
cells

values <-
  cells %>%
  select(-comment) %>%
  behead("up", header) %>%
  select(-col) %>%
  spatter(header)
values

comments <-
  cells %>%
  behead("up", header) %>%
  mutate(header = paste0(header, "_comment")) %>%
  select(row, header, comment) %>%
  spread(header, comment)
comments

left_join(values, comments, by = "row") %>%
  select(-row)
```

## Named ranges
